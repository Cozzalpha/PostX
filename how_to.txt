## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Database & Project Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    cd social_agent
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **Mac/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Initialize the Database:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create an Admin User:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

### 2. Ngrok Setup (Crucial for Facebook API)

Facebook cannot access images on `localhost`. You must tunnel your local server to the internet.

1.  **Install Ngrok** from the link above.
2.  **Authenticate Ngrok** (Run this once):
    ```bash
    ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_TOKEN
    ```
    *(Get your token from the [Ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken))*

To run the full system, you must open **4 separate terminal windows**.

### Terminal 1: Start Redis (The Memory)
This starts the database that holds your scheduled tasks.
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name social-redis redis


1. The "God Mode" (Django Admin Panel)
URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ Login: Use the superuser credentials you created in the terminal (e.g., admin / password).

Stuff to do.
1. Make 5 insta buisness acc and their token and id. TASK:
       
       
        Write a high-engaging Instagram caption using the AIDA framework.
        Include 3-5 emojis and end with 5 hashtags.   
        Keep these stuff in your mind: 
        1. Strong Opening Hook
        The first sentence is crucial, as it determines whether a user stops scrolling. 
        Ask a question to prompt immediate thought or a reply.
        State a surprising fact or statistic to pique curiosity.
        Create urgency or a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).
        Use provocative language that challenges conventional wisdom. 
        2. Clarity and Conciseness
        Get straight to the point.
        Use simple language that is easy to read quickly.
        Employ bullet points or numbered lists to break up text and make it scannable.
        Keep paragraphs short (1-2 sentences typically) to avoid the "wall of text" effect. 
        3. Provide Value
        The best posts offer something in return for the reader's time. 
        Educate the audience with quick tips or insights.
        Inspire with motivational stories or quotes.
        Entertain with humor or relatable anecdotes.
        Solve a problem by addressing common pain points the audience faces. 
        4. Call to Action (CTA)
        Tell the audience exactly what you want them to do next. A clear CTA increases engagement rates . 
        "Comment below..." (for opinions or answers).
        "Share this post if you agree..." (for reach).
        "Link in bio/Swipe up to learn more..." (for driving traffic).
        "Tag a friend who needs this..." (for audience growth). 
        5. Tone and Personality
        The writing should reflect a consistent brand voice that makes the post uniquely yours. 
        Be authentic and avoid sounding like a generic corporate bot.
        Use conversational language as if speaking to a friend.
        Incorporate emojis appropriately to convey emotion and visual interest, making the tone more approachable. 
        6. Searchability and Reach
        While not purely "text," these text-adjacent elements help your post get seen.
        Strategic use of hashtags helps the post get discovered by people who don't follow you .
        Tagging relevant accounts can attract the attention of larger audiences and potential collaborators. 
        ⚠️ STRICT OUTPUT RULES (DO NOT IGNORE):
        1. Return ONLY the final caption text.
        2. Do NOT add introductions like "Here is a caption" or "Sure!".
        3. Do NOT add quotes "" around the text.
        4. Start the response immediately with the hook/headline.
